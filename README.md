# tasky-do

A simple todo application for users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The app should have a clean and intuitive interface, allowing for easy navigation and task management. Features include adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and filtering tasks based on their completion status. The design should be minimalistic, with a focus on functionality and user experience.
